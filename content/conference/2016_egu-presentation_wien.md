This was my first EGU conference. This conference is huge (~15k scientists), and I had the honor to present my work on the _Assessment of multiple daily precipitation statistics in ERA-Interim driven Med-CORDEX and EURO-CORDEX experiments against high resolution observations_ in a 15 minutes oral presentation ([here](https://adrfantini.github.io/files/presentations/2016_egu-presentation_wien.pdf) are the slides) in front of a large crowd, which was quite a fun experience.
