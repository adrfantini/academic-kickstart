This was my second CHyM (CETEMPS Hydrological Model) workshop. I acted as a lab assistant and helped with students; additionally I also gave a 30 minutes presentation on _How to deal with raw station data for hydrological modelling purposes_: [here](https://slides.com/odineidolon/chym2017) are the HTML slides.
