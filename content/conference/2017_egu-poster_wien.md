This was my second EGU conference. I co-authored the poster _Regional-scale flood risk modelling: an integrated hydrological and hydraulic approach applied over the Po river_, whose main author was Rita Nogherotto and which can be found [here](https://adrfantini.github.io/files/posters/2017_egu-poster_wien.pdf).
