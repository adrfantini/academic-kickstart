In this HyMeX conference I presented the first steps in the data cleaning and homogeneisation of the discharge and precipitation datasets that I used later in my PhD thesis. The presentation I gave, titled _Hydrological station-based observations and flood risk modelling over Italy_, can be found [here](https://slides.com/odineidolon/chym2017-2).
