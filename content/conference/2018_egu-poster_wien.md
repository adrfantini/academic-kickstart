This was my third EGU conference. I authored the poster _Evaluation of two new high-resolution EURO-CORDEX RegCM simulations with a new Italian precipitation dataset_, which can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1wPJZMwanpI1yyH2eHXYcjemNWEEvlI1fJPy-9ZvmW18/edit?usp=sharing), and coauthored the poster _Regional climate modeling and flood risk maps: an integrated hydrological and hydraulic approach_, whose main author was Rita Nogherotto.
