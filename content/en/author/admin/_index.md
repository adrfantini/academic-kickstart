My name is Adriano Fantini; I was born in Belluno, Italy in 1990.

My academic background is physics, and I obtained a PhD in Earth Science and Fluid Dynamics in 2019 from the University of Trieste, Italy.
My areas of expertise are climatology, hydrology and data science; I especially enjoy the technical aspects and challenges of data analysis and of the handling of large climatic simulations.

My go-to programming and data analysis language is usually R, and I am also fluent in Python. [Here](https://adrfantini.github.io/r-packages/) you can find a list of my favourite R packages.

Refer to the pages linked in the header if you want to find more about my education, experience or personal life.

Feel free to contact me for any enquiry, preferably by [email](mailto:adr.fantini+website@gmail.com).
