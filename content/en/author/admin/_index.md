My name is Adriano Fantini; I was born in Belluno, Italy in 1990. I currently live in Trieste with my girlfriend and our daughter, born in 2010.

My academic background is physics, and I obtained a PhD in Earth Science and Fluid Dynamics in 2019 from the University of Trieste, Italy.
My areas of expertise are climatology, hydrology and data science; I especially enjoy the technical aspects and challenges of data analysis and of the handling of large climatic simulations, also on High Performance Computing platforms.

My go-to programming and data analysis language is usually R, and I am also fluent in Python. <!--I am very experienced in particular with data handling (R packages `dplyr`, `readr`, `tidyr`, `purrr`), plotting (`ggplot2`) and visualisation (`leaflet`, `mapview`, `shiny`). I use both gridded and sparse spatial data extensively (`raster`, `sf` and `stars`, of which I am a contributor), and built several parallel applications (primarily via the `future` package framework).  -->
