I was born in [Belluno](https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belluno), Italy in 1990, where I lived until I had to move in order to attend university in [Trieste](https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trieste). I lived there, together with my girlfriend and our wonderful daughter, born in 2010, until summer of 2019, when we moved back to Belluno.

I like to get my hands dirty with building, fixing and (often) breaking things: I maintain and repair my car myself and greatly enjoy woodworking and electronics.

I love coding and messing with computers. In particular I have large experience with Linux-based operative systems, which I have been using since 2007. I recently built my own low power home server, which runs on [ArchLinux](https://www.archlinux.org/): you can find more info about it [here]({{< ref "server" >}}).
I'm particularly interested in technology and its role in shaping modern society, privacy, and internet culture.

I am an avid reader: I read all kind of books, but enjoy fantasy, historical and mountaineering books the most. [Here] ( {{< ref "books" >}}) you can read about a few of my favourite books and comics.

Since 2013 I am one of the chief organisers of the [Great snowball fight](https://gbpn.netlify.app/), an epic annual event based on snowballs (and lots of risotto).

Living in Belluno for the most part of my youth left me with a constitutional and unconditioned love for mountains. I love climbing, trekking and hiking, and always find refuge in mountaineering when possible. Read more about it [here] ( {{< ref "mountains" >}}).
