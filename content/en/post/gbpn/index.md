Some healthy self-promotion: as is traditional, on the 4th of January, the first Saturday of the year, we'll organise the usual Grande Battaglia di Palle di Neve (Great Snowball Fight), and this year it's going to be great! Find all the practical details, rules and registration information in the battle's [website](https://gbpn.netlify.com/)!
