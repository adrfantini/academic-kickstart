# Abstract. What's your talk about?
abstract = """This was my third CHyM (CETEMPS Hydrological Model) workshop. I gave three one-hour lectures on:  
1. _How to deal with raw station data for hydrological modelling purposes_  
2. _Climate change impact on flood hazard the Italian case study_  
3. _Statistical analisys for flood mapping estimation_  

I was also, together with Fabio Di Sante, one of the two lab assistants tasked with helping the participants carry out their simulations; this included designing and presenting several tutorials about our models, Linux and running on an HPC cluster.
As with all ICTP workshops, each group of participant had to preset the result of their small project at the end of the two weeks of workshop, which means that we lab assistants also acted as supervisors of their work."""
