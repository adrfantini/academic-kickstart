I started mountaineering when I was 16, and I have trodden many hundreds of kilometers of paths and routes since then. Here's a small collection of a few of my favourite mountain pictures, taken by friends or by myself during hikes or climbs. To me they are not only pretty images, but fond memories of great times.
