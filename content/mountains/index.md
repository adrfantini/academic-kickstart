I started mountaineering when I was 16, and I have trodden many hundreds of kilometers of paths and routes since then. Here's a small collection of a few of my favourite mountain pictures, taken by friends or by myself during hikes or climbs. To me they are not only pretty images, but fond memories of great times.

Click on the images for an interactive gallery.
