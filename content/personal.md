I was born in [Belluno](https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belluno), Italy in 1990, where I lived until I had to move in order to attend university. I now live in [Trieste](https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trieste) together with my girlfriend and our wonderful daughter, born in 2010.

I like to get my hands dirty with building, fixing and (often) breaking things: I maintain and repair my car myself and greatly enjoy woodworking and electronics.

I love coding and messing with computers. In particular I have large experience with Linux-based operative systems, which I have been using since 2007. I recently built my own low power home server, which runs on [ArchLinux](https://www.archlinux.org/): you can find more info about it [here](https://adrfantini.github.io/server/).
I'm particularly interested in technology and its role in shaping modern society, privacy, and internet culture.
<!--I also enjoy video games: my favourite modern game is [Dota2](http://www.dota2.com), which I often play (quite poorly) with friends.-->

I am an avid reader: I read all kind of books, but enjoy fantasy, historical and mountaineering books the most. [Here](https://adrfantini.github.io/books/) you can read about a few of my favourite books and comics.

Living in Belluno for the most part of my youth left me with a constitutional and unconditioned love for mountains. I love climbing, trekking and hiking, and always find refuge in mountaineering when possible. Read more about it [here](https://adrfantini.github.io/mountains/).
