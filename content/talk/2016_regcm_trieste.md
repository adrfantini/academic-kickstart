This was my second RegCM workshop. I acted as a lab assistant and helped with students; additionally I also gave a 30 minutes presentation on the _Assessment of multiple daily precipitation statistics in ERA-Interim driven Med-CORDEX and EURO-CORDEX experiments against high resolution observations_: [here](http://indico.ictp.it/event/7613/session/1/contribution/9/material/slides/0.pdf) are the slides.
