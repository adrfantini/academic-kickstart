This was my third RegCM workshop. I acted as a lab assistant and helped with students; additionally I also gave a 25 minutes presentation on _RegCM for the estimation of flood risk maps: providing driving data for the CHyM hydrological model_: [here](https://slides.com/odineidolon/esfm1-5) are the HTML slides.
