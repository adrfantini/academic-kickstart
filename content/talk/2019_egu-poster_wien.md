This was my fourth EGU conference. I authored the poster _High resolution hydrological simulations show climate change increases flood hazard proxies over Italy_, which can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/19kjdbrlbQMRjU26R6nK6bbCr7w6Dcllv8rGmf_vLm9g/edit?usp=sharing). I was also coauthor of the presentations given by Rita Nogherotto (_Future flood hazard and regional climate modeling: an integrated hydrological and hydraulic approach_) and Erika Coppola (_RegCM CORDEX-atlas simulations: experiment setup, model validation and future
projections for two scenarios (RCP2.6; RCP8.5) over 9 CORDEX domains_).
