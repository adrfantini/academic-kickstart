abstract="We assess the statistics of different daily precipitation indices in ensembles of Med-CORDEX and EURO-CORDEX experiments at high resolution (grid spacing of {\textasciitilde}0.11{\textdegree}, or RCM11) and medium resolution (grid spacing of {\textasciitilde}0.44{\textdegree}, or RCM44) with regional climate models (RCMs) driven by the ERA-Interim reanalysis of observations for the period 1989--2008. The assessment is carried out by comparison with a set of high resolution observation datasets for nine European subregions. The statistics analyzed include quantitative metrics for mean precipitation, daily precipitation probability density functions (PDFs), daily precipitation intensity, frequency, 95th percentile and 95th percentile of dry spell length. We assess an ensemble including all Med-CORDEX and EURO-CORDEX models together and others including the Med-CORDEX and EURO-CORDEX separately. For the All Models ensembles, the RCM11 one shows a remarkable performance in reproducing the spatial patterns and seasonal cycle of mean precipitation over all regions, with a consistent and marked improvement compared to the RCM44 ensemble and the ERA-Interim reanalysis. A good consistency with observations by the RCM11 ensemble (and a substantial improvement compared to RCM44 and ERA-Interim) is found also for the daily precipitation PDFs, mean intensity and, to a lesser extent, the 95th percentile. A general improvement by the RCM11 models is also found when the data are upscaled and intercompared at the 0.44{\textdegree} and 1.5{\textdegree} resolutions. For some regions the RCM11 ensemble overestimates the occurrence of very high intensity events while for one region the models underestimate the occurrence of the most intense extremes. The RCM11 ensemble still shows a general tendency to underestimate the dry day frequency and 95th percentile of dry spell length over wetter regions, with only a marginal improvement compared to the lower resolution models. This indicates that the problem of the excessive production of low precipitation events found in many climate models persists also at relatively high resolutions, at least in wet climate regimes. Concerning the Med-CORDEX and EURO-CORDEX ensembles we find that their performance is of similar quality over the Mediterranean regions analyzed. Finally, we stress the need of consistent and quality checked fine scale observation datasets for the assessment of RCMs run at increasingly high horizontal resolutions.",

    abstract="Floods are one of the most devastating natural disasters, with strong impacts on both society and economy. Flood hazard estimation is an essential tool for protecting the population from floods both financially, via insurance policies, and physically, via water management and engineering. In the last decades, new approaches based on hydrological and hydraulical modelling emerged as viable, which allows for a more robust and reproducible physically-based estimation of flood extent and water level. In this work a multimodel approach has been adopted, with a hydrological model driven by multiple sources of precipitation input data, generating discharge data for a given region or basin for a long time period. The discharge is then fed to a hydrodynamic model which produces of flood extents and, if necessary, other variables such as flood depth or flow speed. Extreme value analysis is also used to derive any Return Period value (ranging from 10 to 500 years) starting from a shorter observational record, by assuming a given distribution for extreme events. We propose a methodology to simulate flood hazard for any return period, based on a model chain comprised of three models: the Regional Climate Model RegCM, the hydrological model CHyM and the hydraulical model CA2D. In order to provide observed precipitation data as input to the hydrological model, we created a new product called GRIPHO (GRidded Italian Precipitation Hourly Observations), which consists of quality checked hourly precipitation observations over the complete Italian territory. We validate GRIPHO against other state-of-the-art precipitation datasets over Italy, showing good performance in reproducing both mean and extreme precipitation: GRIPHO is comparable with the high resolution ARCIS and EURO4M-APGD datasets in Northern Italy, and shows finer spatial details and more consistent extremes than E-OBS in the rest of the domain. Two regional climate simulations, one run in perfect boundary mode (with ERA-Interim) and one a scenario simulation (driven with HadGEM, RCP8.5), are described and validated over the Italian territory. Both simulations show good agreement with observations in several precipitation and temperature metrics, for both extreme and mean climate. The projected climate change signal is also evaluated, finding, on average, increased extreme precipitation even in areas where mean precipitation decreases. Three hydrological simulations, driven by both observations and regional climate model outputs, are described. Validation is carried out against a set of discharge stations, finding generally good performance of the CHyM model for the regions where observations are available. Using different metrics, we assess the future changes in mean and extreme discharge for the Italian territory, finding strong increases in possible flood proxies. In particular, mean discharge is projected to increase (decrease) in Northern Italy in winter (summer), which is directly linked to changes in mean precipitation over the Po river basin. In winter and autumn, maximum yearly discharges increase by 50\% in several Italian regions, with summer and spring showing more mixed results. 100-year Return Period discharges are projected to increase over most of Italy by more than 100\% by the end of the century. Similarly, the frequency of exceedance of extreme discharge thresholds drastically increases in the future scenario compared to the reference period, with changes for the 100-year threshold exceeding 500\% for several rivers in Italy, including the Po river. Finally, we present preliminary results over the whole Italian territory for flood maps for different Return Periods, as produced by a hydraulic model fed by simulated discharge data. The resulting maps are compatible with the currently available products obtained from regional environment agencies, but have the advantage of being produced with a coherent, scientific methodology."
